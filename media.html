    <p>
      I thought I could juggle it all and give 100% at home and at work. This
      quickly led to unexpected burnout and I needed to make a choice that I was
      not prepared for. All stopgaps failed and this forced me to scrutinise my
      life choices and redefine my purpose and identity.

      I needed a break. Took the break and started doing the things that light
      me up. In a bid to use my brain differently, I enrolled in Altschool
      Africa where I am learning to become a world class Engineer. I also practice a lot of yoga to relax and get my mind right. A snippet of a relaxation piece I use when I need a quick session is below:

      I currently invest 50% of my time in:
      <ol>
       <li> coaching new graduates from
        Nigeria on general life planning and </li>
        <li>providing financial education to
          women that enables them build wealth</li>
      </ol> 
    </p>

    <p>I leverage free content like below from Youtube to continously educate myself and stay informed.</p>
